# WineNotes

Nashville will be hosting a huge wine-tasting festival. Over a hundred wineries will be attending with over a thousand
different wines for festival goers to sample over a period of five days. WineNotes is a simple note-
taking app for the festival so that visitors can make notes about the various wines that they taste during their visit.
